        <p> The tour starts on the beach with a quick lesson for everyone and once we're all set up we'll get in the water and start practicing our paddling skills. Once the whole group gathers in the water and feels comfortable, we will start the tour and explore the coast, its secret beaches and some amazing caves that we have around the Albufeira coast.</p>
